# Obsolete

This userscript is now obsolete, as [a permanent fix](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/423542) has now been implemented by Stack Exchange.

## About

This is a highlight.js plugin that was developed in order to enable highlighting in the revision and review pages as it [is currently disabled](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/408993). Apparently, StackExchange has its own definition of "hotfix".

A large part of the userscript's code has been shamelessly stolen from [Deprecate HTML auto-merging from core (plugin may be needed)](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/2889) and follows [this piece of advice](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/2889#issuecomment-862483141).

## Support

Bug reports for the project should be [submitted here](https://github.com/userscripters/restore-highlightjs/issues).
<br>Before adding a new one, please check if it hasn't been raised before.
